# Contributing

Contribution is very welcome to keep this website relevant for newcomers!

We follow a basic git worklfow.
Some command line instructions are provided to help.

## Github repository

1. Fork the github repository at [fpaupier/welcome-to-boston](http://github.com/fpqupier/welcome-to-boston).

2. Clone your local repository.
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:<your-github-username>/welcome-to-boston.git
    ```
   Don't forget to replace `your-github-username`

3. Create a new branch related to the feature you are working on.
    ```
    git checkout -b add-new-source-data
    ```
    And replace `add-new-source-data` with your branch name.

4. Work on on your brand new branch and commit your features on this branch.
    ```bash
    # Add files
    git add myFile
    
    # Commit with a short description
    git commit -m "describe what I've done"
    ```
    
5. Push your changes on your remote branch.
    ```bash
    # On your new branch 
    git push origin 
    ```
    
6. Then, create a pull request from your branch on your own fork and target `fpaupier/welcome-to-boston` `master` branch.
I'll be notified and merge the changes asap. 

Thanks for contributing!
