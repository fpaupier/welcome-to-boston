# Welcome to boston
This repository hosts the content of the static website [Welcometoboston.tech](https://www.welcometoboston.tech).

This website offers a guide for interns / VIE arriving in Boston. It contains blog articles full of insider tips  to make the most out of their experience in the US.

Its content is tailor made for french people since it addresses specific topic such as;
- Dealing with taxes when you are an intern
- Getting the official paperwork done propelry. 

This is a collaborative website and I encourage new comers to contribute and update this website to keep this site relevant and helpful. Thanks!
